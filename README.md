# Analysis of ADS-B data based on a large pre-trained model

This project explores advanced machine learning techniques, with a focus on natural language processing using the GPT-2 model. It is designed for researchers and developers interested in machine learning experiments and model parameter tuning.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the machine learning tasks.
- `Experiments/`: Stores the results of various experiments, including performance metrics and analysis.
- `gpt2/`: Houses specific GPT-2 model parameters and configuration files for replication or further experimentation.
- `scripts/`: Includes scripts for executing models, preprocessing data, and other utility functions.
- `src/`: The source code of the project, where the main algorithms and models reside.
